# 🧠 Heart Disease Prediction using Tree-Based Models
# 📌 Objective
Learn and compare tree-based models for classification using the Heart Disease dataset.

# 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib

# 📊 Steps Performed
## Data Loading & Preprocessing
Loaded heart.csv dataset.
Split into train/test sets.

## Decision Tree Classifier
Trained a Decision Tree Classifier and evaluated its accuracy on test data using accuracy_score.

## Pruned Decision Tree
Limited max depth to control overfitting.
Improved generalization on test data.

## Random Forest Classifier
Trained a Random Forest with 100 trees.
Compared accuracy with Decision Tree.

## Feature Importance
Plotted important features affecting heart disease prediction.

## Cross-Validation
Used 5-fold CV to evaluate both models.

# ✅ Results
Random Forest outperformed Decision Tree in accuracy and stability.
Feature importance helped interpret model decisions.
